  	<p>With always having a great passion for the composition of great music as a young child, the element of music quickly became
      her first love & her ultimate salvation. Growing up in the 80's and 90's & having a musically inclined family that constantly
      surrounded her with the mellow sounds of rhythm and blues and the melodic talents of jazz greats, her adolescent ears were
      constantly filled with a combination of innovatively creative tunes from a variety of sources. This new found love intrigued
      and motivated her to study & admire the creators of every form of music from the genres she found the most interesting such as
      rock, rhythm & blues, jazz and her ultimate favorite hip hop. Growing up in the city of Charlotte, Krystle admired the talents
      that were present in her city but was baffled by the amount of true talent given the opportunity to be heard & loved by their own.
      After receiving her masters degree at the end of 2014, Krystle decided to take on the scholastic management qualities learned
      within her studies & couple them with her working leadership skills & extreme love for music & begin what she hopes will be one
      of the greatest independent musical empires intended on propelling the  careers of the hidden talent out of the city of Charlotte,
      thus birthing her management business Melody Music Management. She currently manages independent hip hop artist Classic Stylez &
      Producer & Composer Jeffery Foster owner & operator of FossOnDaTrack Productions.</p>
