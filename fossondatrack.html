  	<p>FossOnDaTrack Productions owner & operator Jeffery Foster is definitely no stranger to the element of music. From the cultural musical influences from
      his parents who were both musicians themselves, the love of the art was practically destined to be apart of his DNA. Being constantly surrounded around
      the composition & development of live instrumentation from his direct influences, Foss quickly began to catch on to the skills of beat drumming & proficiently
      strumming  guitar strings. After his growing interest for composing music began, his mother took note & decided to purchase him his first computer program
      that allowed him to generate loops for the development of his first song. During a brief interaction with a childhood friend & who would eventually become
      his biggest influence in transitioning into a producer inquired about what he was listening to & discovered he also had a love for creating unique beats,
      his journey into honing his craft became a daily goal.  He became increasingly intrigued to hear his  own ideas turn into tunes and even more eager to hear
      someone else's ideas develop over his music & create an even greater innovative spin. He has stated that music helps to balance him out on the daily
      and is extremely inspiring...</p>
